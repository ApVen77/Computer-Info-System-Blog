- If you're an _embedded developer (and you're writing very near the metal in a very small device), you need to know every in and out of every component in the system.

- If you're a _systems developer (and are writing operating systems or device drivers or maybe even databases), then you'll need to know just about everything there is to know about low-level hardware interfaces.

- If you're a _games developer and late in your project (where you're optimizing things), you need to know the ins and outs of the CPU cache and graphics architectures you'll be using.

- If you're an _applications developer, you don't need to know any of this except keeping memory usage at reasonable levels.

- If you're a _web developer, it's handy to know internet protocols, but none of this other stuff is necessary except how to deal with memory issues.
